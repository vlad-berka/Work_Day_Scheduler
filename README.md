# Code Quiz (Javascript Questions)
## Vladimir Berka's Homework #5, Workday Scheduler

## Assignment Description
This is a CSS/HTML/Javascript homework assignment for the UW Bootcamp. The goal of the assignment is to create a single web page application that is able to schedule a day's events. HTML and CSS files were provided. The Javascript file is the primary challenge of this assignment. 

A mockup is provided by the instructor to demonstrate desired application functionality.

The original user story, acceptance criteria, and mockup for the assignment is copied to the end of this document.

## Assignment Scope
Create a single web application that allows a user to plan out the day's events using JQuery and the Bootstrap front end framework.

Basic HTML and CSS starting code has been provided.

## Generalized Tasks
- Use Bootstrap and populate the DOM with the: time, a text area, and a save button
- Write a javascript file with multiple functions to handle scheduling operations (pull data, write data, save data)  
- Use `moment()` and add date information to the webpage
- Use `Buttons` and `listenerEvents` to add web app functionality and responsiveness
- Store scheduling data in `localStorage`

## Summary of Work Completed
A wireframe of the web app was sketched out physically on paper to indicate the desired box layout, appearance, and generalized HTML tag schema. Javascript functions were written to create, delete, and modify the original HTML elements as loaded into the DOM. The original header introducing the quiz was deleted using `remove()` with the remaining elements modified using `.textContent` to introduce the questions and list of answers. HTML element appearance was modified using `.setAttribute` to change classes as the appearance of HTML elements changed by using pre-declared CSS selectors. Scores were tracked using a global variable that was then stored in `localStorage`. The highscores were sorted with every run; as the current score would be inserted into the high scores in descending order, and then `setItem` back up to `localStorage`. 

Generally speaking, the assignment leaned heavily on the use of `listenerEvents` and `event.target` attributes to cycle through questions and determine correct answers.
